TITLE:Lession1: Introduction to Serious Programming

Concept_Title:Computer
Concept_Description:
Most machines (like a toaster) are designed to do a few things.
Unless you physically alter these machines, they will only be able to do those things.
Computers are different.
A computer can be programmed to do anything we want, as long as we can write a program that specifies a specific sequence of instructions.

Concept_Title:Program
Concept_Description:
A program is a precise sequence of steps that a computer can follow to do something useful. Web browsers, games, mobile apps, and simple print statements are all examples of computer programs.


Concept_Title:Programming Languages
Concept_Description:
A programming language is what programmers use to tell a computer what to do. Python is one example of a programming language.



Concept_Title:Interpreter
Concept_Description:
An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into a machine language program.



Concept_Title:Python
Concept_Description:
Python is a programming language. When you write Python code and press 'Run', a Python Interpreter converts the code you wrote as a set of instructions that the computer itself can understand and execute.


Concept_Title:Grammar
Concept_Description:
Just like human languages have grammars, programming languages do too. A grammar is a specification of what is "correct" and what is "incorrect."


Concept_Title:Python expressions
Concept_Description:
A Python "expression" is a legal Python statement. For example: print 1 + 1 is a valid expression, but print 1 + (without a number at the end) is not.

TITLE:Lession2: Variables and Strings

Concept_Title:Variable
Concept_Description:
A variable or scalar is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity or information referred to as a value.


Concept_Title:Commend
Concept_Description:
In python language, using <b>'#'</b> in front of a line will mark all line as command and ignored by interpreter.


Concept_Title:'=' vs. '=='
Concept_Description:
'=' means assignment, when a = c, it means assign 'c' as value of 'a'.
'==' means equality, when a == c, it means 'a' equal to 'c'.

TITLE:Lession3: Input > Function > Output

Concept_Title:What is a function
Concept_Description:
A function is something that takes input, does something to that input, and then produces output.

Concept_Title:What is the difference between making and using a function?
Concept_Description:
Functions are made by starting a line of code with the keyword def and then giving a function name followed by the function parameters in parentheses. These parameters will eventually be replaced by actual values when the function is used (called).
To use a function, we write the name of the function followed by the value(s) we want to give it in parentheses. Like this:


Concept_Title:How do functions help programmers avoid repetition?
Concept_Description:
Functions are tools that programmers can create and reuse forever! Once you've defined a function once, you never have to define it again.
